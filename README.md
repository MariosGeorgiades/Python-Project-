# Python Fundamentals: The Academic Start 🐍

This repository represents the beginning of my journey with **Python**. These projects were developed during my school years, serving as my first introduction to high-level programming, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

### 🎯 Project Purpose
The goal of this repository was to master the core building blocks of Python. It covers the transition from basic syntax to functional programming, providing the logical foundation I now use for **System Architecture** and **Machine Learning**.

### ⌨️ Key Concepts Explored
* **Control Flow:** Mastering `if/else` logic and `while/for` loops.
* **Data Handling:** Working with lists, dictionaries, and basic file I/O.
* **Functions & Modularity:** Writing reusable code and understanding scope.
* **Problem Solving:** Solving mathematical and logical puzzles through code.

### 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Environment:** Developed primarily in a school lab setting.
* **Focus:** Logic development and clean syntax.
